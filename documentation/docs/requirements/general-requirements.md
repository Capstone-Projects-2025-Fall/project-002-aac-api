# General Requirements

This page describes the main tools, platforms, and resources our team is using to develop and test the project. The goal is to make sure everyone can work in a consistent environment and understand what’s needed to build and maintain the system effectively.

---

## 1. Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Git & GitHub** – used for version control, collaboration, and hosting our documentation through Docusaurus.  
- **Node.js** (v18 or later) – runs both the Express backend and the Docusaurus site.  
- **Python 3.x** – supports backend functionality and potential AAC-related features down the line.  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – our main editor for coding and documentation work.  
- **Discord** – used for quick communication and group coordination.  
- **Jira** – tracks tasks and helps us stay organized during sprints.

*(We may add or replace some tools later as the project develops.)*

---

## 2. Hardware Requirements

- A **laptop or desktop computer** that can run Node.js and Python smoothly.  
- **Microphone access**, needed for testing AAC and speech-based features.  
- **Speakers or headphones**, for listening to audio output.

---

## 3. Software Dependencies

Below are the main technologies we’re currently using or planning to integrate:

| Category | Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Backend | **Express (Node.js)** | Handles API routing and server logic |
| Backend Support | **Python** | Used for AAC-related logic or potential data processing |
| Frontend | **Docusaurus** | Manages and hosts the project documentation |
| Reference Tool | **CoughDrop** | Used to reference and test AAC boards and speech interaction |

*(These may change or expand as new features are added.)*

---

## 4. Network Requirements

- **Internet Access** – required for using GitHub, Docusaurus, and CoughDrop.  
- **Stable Connection** – helpful for testing any real-time or online features tied to AAC interactions.

---

## 5. Documentation & Collaboration Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **GitHub** | Stores the codebase and documentation, and tracks version history |
| **Docusaurus** | Generates and hosts our documentation site |
| **Jira** | Organizes work items and team progress |
| **Discord** | Main communication platform for daily collaboration |

---

## 6. Summary

These tools and requirements make up the foundation of our development process. Keeping everyone on the same setup helps us avoid compatibility issues and stay consistent. As we continue building the project, we’ll update this page with any new tools or dependencies that get added.
