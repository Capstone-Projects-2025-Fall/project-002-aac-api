Below are the project branches and the naming conventions we follow when new branches are created for clarity:

**Branches and Branching Naming Convention**:
- 'main' - Holds the most stable and **up-to-date** version of the project
- 'feature/feature-name' - New features added
- 'bugfix/bug-desription' - Bug fixes
- 'docs/what-docs' - Documentation updates
- 'test/test-description' - Test additions

### Branch Protection Rules

Branch rules to maintain high code quality and security:

## Summary
Version control is an important part of the project as it keeps code organized, allows for easy collaboration, and provides a history of log of all changes made to the project. Some key practices to follow:
- Pull before starting work
- Commit with clear messages on what changes were made
- Push regulary
- Use branches for testing and new features
- Review and test before attempting to merge
- Ask others to extensively review any changes made

Following these practices will ensure that development of the project will run smoothly and make collaboration easy for everyone.
