## Keywords

Section 2, API, programming language as of yet undefined

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a coding API to better allow accessibility in video games. It will allow developers to more easily connect their games to audio-to-text programs, allowing them to manipulate the in-game controls through the use of an AAC machine. On playback the API will run an audio-to-text program on it and check for if the produced text has been set as any possible inputs in the connected game and execute them if found to be true.

## High Level Requirement

This api will be control the in between communications between games and the users AAC machine, allowing for control of the game purely with audio playback.

## Conceptual Design

Currently undecided

## Background

Rudimentary How To Run Instructions:

Required tools:

npm, yarn, python3/pip, node.js, express.js

Clone Project.

Navigate to /Initial_API and run "npm install". Then, run "node ."

Navigate to /documentation and run "yarn install", then "yarn start".

This should open http://localhost:3000/undefined/ in your browser. Then, navigate to http://localhost:3000/undefined/tic-tac-toe

The game should connect to the python API in order to process voice.

## Required Resources

More research is needed
