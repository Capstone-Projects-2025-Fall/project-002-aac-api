## Keywords

Section 2, API, programming language as of yet undefined

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a coding API to better allow accessibility in video games. It will allow developers to more easily connect their games to audio-to-text programs, allowing them to manipulate the in-game controls through the use of an AAC machine. On playback the API will run an audio-to-text program on it and check for if the produced text has been set as any possible inputs in the connected game and execute them if found to be true.

## High Level Requirement

This api will be control the in between communications between games and the users AAC machine, allowing for control of the game purely with audio playback.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
